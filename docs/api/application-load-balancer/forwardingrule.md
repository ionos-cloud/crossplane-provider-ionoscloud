# ForwardingRule Managed Resource

## Overview

* Resource Name: `ForwardingRule`
* Resource Group: `alb.ionoscloud.crossplane.io`
* Resource Version: `v1alpha1`
* Resource Scope: `Cluster`

## Usage

In order to manage resources on IONOS Cloud using Crossplane Provider, you need to have Crossplane Provider for IONOS Cloud installed into a Kubernetes Cluster, as a prerequisite. For a step-by-step guide, check the following [link](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/crossplane-provider-ionoscloud/tree/master/examples/example.md).

It is recommended to clone the repository for easier access to the example files.

### Create

Use the following command to create a resource instance. Before applying the file, check the properties defined in the `spec.forProvider` fields:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/ionoscloud/alb/forwardingrule.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

### Update

Use the following command to update an instance. Before applying the file, update the properties defined in the `spec.forProvider` fields:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/ionoscloud/alb/forwardingrule.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

### Wait

Use the following commands to wait for resources to be ready and synced. Update the `<instance-name>` accordingly:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready forwardingrules.alb.ionoscloud.crossplane.io/<instance-name>
```

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=synced forwardingrules.alb.ionoscloud.crossplane.io/<instance-name>
```

### Get

Use the following command to get a list of the existing instances:

```bash
kubectl get -f forwardingrules.alb.ionoscloud.crossplane.io
```

_Note_: Use options `--output wide`, `--output json` to get more information about the resource instances.

### Delete

Use the following command to destroy the resources created by applying the file:

```bash
kubectl delete -f examples/ionoscloud/alb/forwardingrule.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.
