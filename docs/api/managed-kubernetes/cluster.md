# Cluster Managed Resource

## Overview

* Resource Name: `Cluster`
* Resource Group: `k8s.ionoscloud.crossplane.io`
* Resource Version: `v1alpha1`
* Resource Scope: `Cluster`

## Usage

In order to manage resources on IONOS Cloud using Crossplane Provider, you need to have Crossplane Provider for IONOS Cloud installed into a Kubernetes Cluster, as a prerequisite. For a step-by-step guide, check the following [link](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/crossplane-provider-ionoscloud/tree/master/examples/example.md).

It is recommended to clone the repository for easier access to the example files.

### Create

Use the following command to create a resource instance. Before applying the file, check the properties defined in the `spec.forProvider` fields:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/ionoscloud/k8s/k8s-cluster.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

### Update

Use the following command to update an instance. Before applying the file, update the properties defined in the `spec.forProvider` fields:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/ionoscloud/k8s/k8s-cluster.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

### Wait

Use the following commands to wait for resources to be ready and synced. Update the `<instance-name>` accordingly:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready clusters.k8s.ionoscloud.crossplane.io/<instance-name>
```

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=synced clusters.k8s.ionoscloud.crossplane.io/<instance-name>
```

### Get

Use the following command to get a list of the existing instances:

```bash
kubectl get -f clusters.k8s.ionoscloud.crossplane.io
```

_Note_: Use options `--output wide`, `--output json` to get more information about the resource instances.

### Delete

Use the following command to destroy the resources created by applying the file:

```bash
kubectl delete -f examples/ionoscloud/k8s/k8s-cluster.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

## Properties

In order to configure the IONOS Cloud Resource, the user can set the `spec.forProvider` fields into the specification file for the resource instance. The required fields that need to be set can be found [here](#required-properties). Following, there is a list of all the properties:

* `name` (string)
	* description: A Kubernetes cluster name. Valid Kubernetes cluster name must be 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.
* `s3Buckets` (array)
	* description: List of S3 bucket configured for K8s usage. For now, it contains only an S3 bucket used to store K8s API audit logs.
	* properties:
		* `name` (string)
	* required properties:
		* `name`
* `apiSubnetAllowList` (array)
	* description: Access to the K8s API server is restricted to these CIDRs. Traffic, internal to the cluster, is not affected by this restriction. If no allow-list is specified, access is not restricted. If an IP without subnet mask is provided, the default value is used: 32 for IPv4 and 128 for IPv6. Example: "1.2.3.4/32", "2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101/64", "1.2.3.4", "2002::1234:abcd:ffff:c0a8:101"
* `k8sVersion` (string)
	* description: The Kubernetes version the cluster is running. This imposes restrictions on what Kubernetes versions can be run in a cluster's nodepools. Additionally, not all Kubernetes versions are viable upgrade targets for all prior versions. Example: 1.15.4
* `maintenanceWindow` (object)
	* description: The maintenance window is used for updating the cluster's control plane and for upgrading the cluster's K8s version. If no value is given, one is chosen dynamically, so there is no fixed default.
	* properties:
		* `dayOfTheWeek` (string)
			* description: DayOfTheWeek The name of the week day.
		* `time` (string)

### Required Properties

The user needs to set the following properties in order to configure the IONOS Cloud Resource:

* `name`
