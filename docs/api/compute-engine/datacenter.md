# Datacenter Managed Resource

## Overview

* Resource Name: `Datacenter`
* Resource Group: `compute.ionoscloud.crossplane.io`
* Resource Version: `v1alpha1`
* Resource Scope: `Cluster`

## Usage

In order to manage resources on IONOS Cloud using Crossplane Provider, you need to have Crossplane Provider for IONOS Cloud installed into a Kubernetes Cluster, as a prerequisite. For a step-by-step guide, check the following [link](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/crossplane-provider-ionoscloud/tree/master/examples/example.md).

It is recommended to clone the repository for easier access to the example files.

### Create

Use the following command to create a resource instance. Before applying the file, check the properties defined in the `spec.forProvider` fields:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/ionoscloud/compute/datacenter.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

### Update

Use the following command to update an instance. Before applying the file, update the properties defined in the `spec.forProvider` fields:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/ionoscloud/compute/datacenter.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

### Wait

Use the following commands to wait for resources to be ready and synced. Update the `<instance-name>` accordingly:

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready datacenters.compute.ionoscloud.crossplane.io/<instance-name>
```

```bash
kubectl wait --for=condition=synced datacenters.compute.ionoscloud.crossplane.io/<instance-name>
```

### Get

Use the following command to get a list of the existing instances:

```bash
kubectl get -f datacenters.compute.ionoscloud.crossplane.io
```

_Note_: Use options `--output wide`, `--output json` to get more information about the resource instances.

### Delete

Use the following command to destroy the resources created by applying the file:

```bash
kubectl delete -f examples/ionoscloud/compute/datacenter.yaml
```

_Note_: The command should be run from the root of the `crossplane-provider-ionoscloud` directory.

## Properties

In order to configure the IONOS Cloud Resource, the user can set the `spec.forProvider` fields into the specification file for the resource instance. The required fields that need to be set can be found [here](#required-properties). Following, there is a list of all the properties:

* `description` (string)
	* description: A description for the datacenter, such as staging, production.
* `location` (string)
	* description: The physical location where the datacenter will be created. This will be where all of your servers live. Property cannot be modified after datacenter creation (disallowed in update requests). Location can have the following values: de/fra, us/las, us/ewr, de/txl, gb/lhr, es/vit.
* `name` (string)
	* description: The name of the  resource.
* `secAuthProtection` (boolean)
	* description: Boolean value representing if the data center requires extra protection, such as two-step verification.

### Required Properties

The user needs to set the following properties in order to configure the IONOS Cloud Resource:

* `location`
