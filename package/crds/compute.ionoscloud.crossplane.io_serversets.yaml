          ServerSet represents a stateful set of servers in the Ionos Cloud.
          The number of replicas controls how many resources it creates in the Ionos Cloud.
          For 2 replicas defined, it will create for each: 1 server, 1 bootvolume, the nics configured(for each server).
          Each sub-resource created(server, bootvolume, nic) will have it's own CR that can be observed using kubectl.
          The SSet reads the active(master) identity from a configMap that needs to be named `config-lease`. If the configMap is not found, the active replica will be the first server created.

                              StateMap points to a user-created configMap to pull the running state of the server from. This is meant to be used
                              in scenarios where the state of the software running on the server is needed. We expect the software to report its state

                              This will work in conjunction with the API state and it can be seen as a logical AND between the API state and the software state.

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
