          A StatefulServerSet is a an API type that represents a set of servers with data Volumes attached in the Ionos Cloud. The number of resources created is defined by the replicas field.
          This includes the servers, boot volume, data volumes NICs and LANs configured in the template. It will also create a volumeselector which attaches data Volumes to the servers.
          Unlike a K8s StatefulSet, a StatefulServerSet does not keep the data Volumes in sync. The information on the active replica is `NOT` propagated to the passives.
          Each sub-resource created(server, bootvolume, datavolume, nic) will have it's own CR that can be observed using kubectl.
          The SSSet reads the active(master) identity from a configMap that needs to be named `config-lease`. If the configMap is not found, the master will be the first server created.

                              StateMap points to a user-created configMap to pull the running state of the server from. This is meant to be used
                              in scenarios where the state of the software running on the server is needed. We expect the software to report its state
                              in this configMap. This will work in conjunction with the API state and it can be seen as a logical AND between
                              the API state and the software state.

                              There will be 2 entries expected for a server in the state map in order to consider the state valid:

                                   1. <server-name>-state : the state of the server (e.g. VM-RUNNING, VM-ERROR)
                                   2. <server-name>-timestamp : the timestamp of the last update of the state, only RFC3339 format is accepted (e.g. 2025-10-15T11:26:20+00:00)

                              Accepted states are: VM-RUNNING, VM-ERROR. Any other state will be considered as not ready.
                              If the configMap is not found or one of the two keys is not found, the serverset will be considered not ready.
                              The timestamp is used to ensure that the server can update and failover correctly if the case requires it.
                              A missing timestamp or one that does not follow the RFC3339 format will cause the server to be considered not ready
                              in the observation loop. For an update, if the timestamp is not the appropriate format, it will error out.
